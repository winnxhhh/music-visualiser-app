# Music Visualiser Application

Welcome to my music visualiser application! This was made in September 2023 for a school project. I hope you enjoy playing around with it :D

To launch the application:
1. open the code in VSCode or any of your preferred IDE
2. open the code in LIVE PREVIEW
3. copy the URL generated in the live preview and paste in your desired browser (google chrome or mozilla firefox is recommended)
4. enjoy!
